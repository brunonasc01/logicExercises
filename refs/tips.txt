Note that the time complexity of the above Dynamic Programming (DP) solution is O(n^2) and there is a O(nLogn) solution for the LIS problem.
We have not discussed the O(n Log n) solution here as the purpose of this post is to explain Dynamic Programming with a simple example. See below post for O(n Log n) solution.

irstly one would need to define what more efficient means, does it mean quicker, uses less system resources (such as memory) etc... (these factors are sometimes mutually exclusive)
